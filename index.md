# Henrik Sterner

Graduate of computer science and mathematics with a minor in psychology from the University of Copenhagen. 

I teach subjects in mathematics and computer science at [NEXT Sukkertoppen](https://nextkbh.dk) in Valby. Among the primary courses I teach are: 

- [Machine learning and data science](https://henriksterner.github.io/IntelligenteSystemer/)
- [Programming and software development](https://henriksterner.github.io/P5Programmering/).
- [Game development and AI in gaming](https://henriksterner.github.io/Unity/).

Check out my [GitHub repository](github.com/HenrikSterner) for more information about projects and work related to teaching.

In addition, I maintain a serious professional interest in other areas of computer science and mathematics including data mining and machine learning applied to computational finance, computational geometry and topology and parallel/distributed algorithms. Most of m coding in these areas are done in Python, Java, C\# and C++.
