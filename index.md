# Henrik Sterner

Graduate of computer science and mathematics with a minor in psychology from the University of Copenhagen. 

I teach the following [NEXT Sukkertoppen](https://nextkbh.dk) in Valby 

- [Applied Machine learning and data science](https://henriksterner.github.io/IntelligenteSystemer/): Fundamentals algorithms and techniques for machine learning, deep learning and data science.
- [Programming and software development](https://henriksterner.github.io/P5Programmering/). Courses in basic object-oriented programming and functional programming in Python, C\#, Javascript/Typescript, C/C++ and F#/Haskell.
- [Game development and AI in gaming](https://henriksterner.github.io/Unity/).  Developing 2D/3d games in Unity/Unreal Enigine with different types of AI.
- Mathematics. Calculus, linear algebra, probability theory and statistics.

Check out my [GitHub page](http://www.github.com/HenrikSterner) for more information about projects and work primarly related to teaching.

Early in my career I have been a TA at the University of Copenhagen in Algorithms and data structures and Advanced algorithms.

In addition to my teaching, I maintain a serious professional interest in other areas of computer science including:

- machine learning and data mining applied to computational finance with focus on prediction of financial time series and stock prices but also in the context of modelling product prices and sales.
- computational geometry and computational topology with applications in analysis of markets making informed decisions about investments but also earlier on protein structure prediction.

I have preveiously been active in the following areas:
- parallel/distributed algorithms applied in the context of  and cryptography
- Computability theory and complexity theory
  
Most of my coding done in these areas are done in Python, Java, C\# and C++.
