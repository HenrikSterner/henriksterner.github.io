Graduate of computer science and mathematics with a minor in psychology from the University of Copenhagen. 

I am a highschool teacher in computer science (programming, informatics and technical engineering) and mathematics.
Main subjects of teaching include: [Applied Machine learning and data science](https://henriksterner.github.io/IntelligenteSystemer/), [programming and software development](https://henriksterner.github.io/P5Programmering/), [Game development,  Game-AI](https://henriksterner.github.io/Unity/) and [mathematics](https://www.uvm.dk/-/media/filer/uvm/gym-laereplaner-2017/htx/matematik-a-htx-august-2017-ua.pdf). 

## Teaching and Research Interests

Check out my [GitHub page](http://www.github.com/HenrikSterner) for more information about projects and work primarly related to teaching. Currently, I teach courses in

- [P5 Programming](https://henriksterner.github.io/P5Programmering/) for creative coding and visual programming.
- [Python Programming](https://henriksterner.github.io/IntroPython) for general purpose programming. Collections of exercises in Python programming can be found in [Python Exercises](https://henriksterner.github.io/PythonExercises/).
- [Machine Learning and Data Science](https://henriksterner.github.io/IntelligenteSystemer/) for applied machine learning and data science.

Earlier I was a TA at the University of Copenhagen in Algorithms and data structures and Advanced algorithms.

In addition to my teaching, I maintain a serious professional interest in other areas of computer science including:

- machine learning and data mining applied to computational finance with focus on prediction of financial time series and stock prices but also in the context of modelling product prices and sales.
- computational geometry and computational topology with applications in analysis of markets making informed decisions about investments but also earlier on used for protein structure prediction. Read more in this [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220939592_Alpha_Shapes_and_Proteins).  

I have preveiously been active in the following areas:

- parallel/distributed algorithms applied in the context of  and cryptography
- Computability theory and complexity theory
- didactics of computer science with focus on how to develop and train computational thinking to highschool students. In 2017 I was part of a team that developed a new curriculum for [programming](https://www.uvm.dk/-/media/filer/uvm/gym-laereplaner-2017/valgfag/programmering-b-valgfag-august-2017.pdf) in highschool in Denmark. In 2023 I published a paper about a course of study in basic [object oriented programming for highschool students](https://emu.dk/htx/programmering/avancerede-konstruktioner/algoritmer-i-naturen-emergerende-flokadfaerd-og?b=t6-t1084). Im also a superviser of students in highschool teachers doing their pedagogy exam in computer science. 
  
Most of my coding done in these areas are done in Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java, C\# and C/C++.

## Book

I am the co-author of the book ["Programming in P5"](https://henriksterner.github.io/p5) together with Peter Sterner. The book is written in Danish and targets highschool students learning programming for the first time. The book uses the P5.js framework for creative coding and visual programming to teach basic programming concepts and problem solving skills.
